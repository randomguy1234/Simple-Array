# Simple-Array
The purpose of this program was to ask the user to enter the amount of numbers that he/she wanted to put unto the array. The user 
then enters a value into each slot of the array. Then the program assumes  the user wants to insert a new value and asks the user 
where they want to enter the new value. The program then prints out the contents of the array.
